# FAULT-CLASSIFICATION-USING-ACOUSTIC-SIGNAL-IN-ELECTRIC-MOTORS
# Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based diagnostic system that leverages acoustic signals for non-invasive, real-time fault detection in electric motors. Using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) extracted from vibration recordings, we trained multiple neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, and CNN+RNN) to classify motor bearing faults with high accuracy, even in noisy industrial environments.
