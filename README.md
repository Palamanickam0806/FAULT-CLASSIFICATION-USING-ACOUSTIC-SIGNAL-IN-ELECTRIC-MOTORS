# FAULT-CLASSIFICATION-USING-ACOUSTIC-SIGNAL-IN-ELECTRIC-MOTORS
# Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based diagnostic system that leverages acoustic signals for non-invasive, real-time fault detection in electric motors. Using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) extracted from vibration recordings, we trained multiple neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, and CNN+RNN) to classify motor bearing faults with high accuracy, even in noisy industrial environments.
# Scope
  Early Detection of Motor Faults: Identify defects such as single-point failures in drive and fan end bearings.
  
  Acoustic-Based Diagnostics: Use audio signals instead of traditional vibration sensors for a more cost-effective, flexible solution.
  
  Robust Modeling: Handle noisy environments with minimal preprocessing using deep learning.
  
  Efficiency & Real-Time Focus: Tailored for edge deployment using quantization and model approximation.
